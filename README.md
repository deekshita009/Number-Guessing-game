I developed a **Number Guessing Game** using **Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**, offering a graphical and interactive experience for players. Unlike standard number games, this version allows the user to first **set a custom range** within which a secret number will be randomly generated by the system. This makes the game more flexible and personalized based on the difficulty the user prefers.

Once the range is set, the player is given **three chances** to guess the secret number. After every attempt, the game provides **hints** to guide the user â€” such as whether the guess is **close** or **far away** from the secret number. These intelligent hints help the player make better decisions in the following guesses, adding a logical edge to the game instead of relying purely on luck.

If the user successfully guesses the number within the given attempts, a congratulatory message is displayed. If all three chances are used up without a correct guess, the player can see the **secret number**. After the game ends, users can restart and play again with a new range and number.

The entire interface is built using **Java AWT components** like `Frame`, `Label`, `TextField`, and `Button`. Event handling is managed using `ActionListener`, providing a smooth and responsive interaction between the user and the application. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **GUI design in Java**, **event-driven programming**, and implementing **game logic** within a structured and user-friendly interface.

This game can serve as a beginner-friendly project for those exploring Java GUI development.
